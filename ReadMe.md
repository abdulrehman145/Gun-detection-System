# Gun Detection Security Feed

This project is a real-time **gun detection system** built using OpenCV and a Haar Cascade classifier. It captures live video from a webcam and highlights detected guns on screen, offering a basic security surveillance application.

## Features

- Real-time webcam feed
- Gun detection using Haar cascade
- Visual bounding boxes around detected objects
- Logs detection status at session end
- Simple and lightweight implementation

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- Haar Cascade (XML classifier)
- NumPy
- imutils

## Requirements

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python imutils numpy
